## Introduction
This project uses the well-known **Iris Flower Dataset**, which is often used for beginner classification tasks in machine learning. The goal is to classify the flowers into one of three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples, with 4 features for each sample:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Each sample belongs to one of the three Iris flower species.

## Project Structure
The structure of the project is as follows:
```
├── data/                # Contains the dataset (optional)
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks used during development
├── src/                 # Python scripts for training and evaluating models
├── results/             # Generated results and model outputs
├── README.md            # This README file
└── requirements.txt     # Required packages for the project
```

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can run the classification model by executing the Python scripts or the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks` folder.

Example for training the model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

## Model Performance
The Random Forest classifier was trained and evaluated using cross-validation. The model achieved **X% accuracy** on the test dataset, with the following precision and recall scores:

| Metric       | Score  |
|--------------|--------|
| Accuracy     | 1.00   |
| Precision    | 1.00   |
| Recall       | 1.00   |
| F1 Score     | 1.00   |

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn/Matplotlib (for visualization)
